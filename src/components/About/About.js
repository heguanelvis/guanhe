                        I grew up in China, and had my{" "}
                        <strong>BA in International Studies</strong>, focusing
                        on comparative politics and governance practices. In
                        2017, I attended the{" "}
                        <strong>University of Chicago</strong>, where I learned
                        data analytics and visualization, specifically in the
                        context of making policies. At the same time, I took
                        multiple civic technology courses and developed an
                        enthusiasm for programming.{" "}

                        In the summer of 2019, I graduated with a{" "}
                        <strong>Master of Public Policy</strong> and decided
                        that I want to further my skills and pursue a career in
                        technology. Currently, I am a full-time{" "}
                        <strong>Java student at Tech Elevator</strong> learning
                        about Test Driven Development and the Spring Framework.

                    <strong>D3.js</strong> to create interactive and mobile
                    responsive visualizations. Recently, I have been focusing on
                    learning Java, specifically in terms of{" "}
                    <strong>Spring MVC and Test Driven Development</strong>. I

                    In my spare time, I really enjoy trying out various cuisines
                    and cooking all kinds of food. I also like going to karaoke
                    bars, swimming, playing video games, taking care of my
                    plants and spending time with my kitty. In addition, I love
                    attending hackathons and tech conferences to meet
                    interesting people and I am looking forward to making more
                    friends in the Detroit area.
